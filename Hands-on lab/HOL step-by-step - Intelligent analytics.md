# Intelligent analytics hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to many of Microsoft's transformative line of business applications built using Microsoft advanced analytics. The goal is to show an end-to-end solution, leveraging many of these technologies, but not necessarily doing work in every component possible.

By the end of the hands-on lab, you will be more confident in the various services and technologies provided by Azure, and how they can be combined to build a real-time chat solution that is enhanced by Cognitive Services.

## Overview

First Up Consultants specialize in building software solutions for the hospitality industry. Their latest product is an enterprise mobile/social chat product called Concierge+ (aka ConciergePlus). The mobile web app enables guests to easily stay in touch with the concierge and other guests, enabling greater personalization and improving their experience during their stay. Sentiment analysis is performed on top of chat messages as they occur, enabling hotel operators to keep tabs on guest sentiments in real-time.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The preferred solution is shown to meet the customer requirements. From right to left there is an architecture diagram which shows the connections from a mobile device to a Web Application. The Web Application is shown setting data to an Event Hub which is connected to a Web Job. From there Event Hub and Service Bus work together with Stream Analytics, Power BI and Cosmos DB to provide the full solution.](media/preferred-solution-architecture3.png "Solution architecture")

Messages are sent from browsers running within laptop or mobile clients via SignalR to an endpoint running in an Azure Web App. Chat messages received by the Web App are sent to an Event Hub where they are temporarily stored. An Azure Function picks up the chat messages and applies sentiment analysis to the message text (using the Text Analytics API), as well as contextual understanding (using LUIS). The function forwards the chat message to an Event Hub used to store messages for archival purposes, and to a Service Bus Topic which is used to deliver the message to the intended recipients. A Stream Analytics Job provides a simple mechanism for pulling the chat messages from the second Event Hub and writing them to Cosmos DB for archiving, and to Power BI for visualization of sentiment in real-time as well as trending sentiment. An indexer runs atop Cosmos DB that updates the Azure Search index which provides full text search capability. Messages in the Service Bus Topic are pulled by Subscriptions created in the Web App and running on behalf of each client device connected by SignalR. When the Subscription receives a message, it is pushed via SignalR down to the browser-based app and displayed in a web page. Bot Services hosts a bot created using QnA maker, which automatically answers simple questions asked by site visitors.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio Community 2019 or later.
  - Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio 2019).

## Exercise 1: Environment setup

Duration: 60 minutes

The following section walks you through the manual steps to provision the services required in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).  First Up Consultants have provided a starter solution for you. They have asked you to use this as the starting point for creating the Concierge Plus intelligent chat solution in Azure.

### Task 1: Connect to the lab VM

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and select Resource groups from the left-hand menu, then enter intelligent-analytics into the filter box, and select the resource group from the list.

    ![On the Resource groups screen, intelligent-analytics is typed in the search field. In the search results, intelligent-analytics is selected.](media/image10.png "Azure Portal Resource groups")

2. Next, select **LabVM** from the list of available resources.

    ![In the List of available resources, LabVM is selected.](media/image11.png "List of available resources")

3. On the LabVM blade, select **Connect** from the top menu, which will download an RDP file.

    ![The Connect button is selected on the LabVM blade toolbar.](media/image12.png "LabVM blade")

4. Open the downloaded RDP file.

5. Select Connect on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

    ![The Remote Desktop Connection window states that the publisher of the remote connection can't be identified, and asks if you want to connect anyway. The Connect button is selected.](media/image13.png "Remote Desktop Connection")

6. Enter the following credentials (or the non-default credentials if you changed them):

    - **Username**: `demouser`

    - **Password**: (your password)

7. Select Yes to connect, if prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

    ![The Remote Desktop Connection window states that the identity of the remote computer can't be identified, and asks if you want to connect anyway. The Yes button is selected.](media/image15.png "Remote Desktop Connection window")

8. Open **Internet Explorer**, then download and install Edge.

### Task 2: Download and open the ConciergePlus starter solution

1. From your Lab VM, download the starter project by downloading a .zip copy of the Intelligent analytics GitHub repo.

2. In a web browser, navigate to the [Intelligent analytics MCW repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Intelligent-analytics).

3. On the repo page, select **Clone or download**, then select **Download ZIP**.

    ![Download .zip containing the Intelligent analytics repository](media/git-hub-download-repo.png "Download ZIP")

    >**Note**: You can alternatively just enter [this](https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Intelligent-analytics/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) URL into the browser to directly initiate the download.

4. Unzip the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to the folder **C:\\ConciergePlus**\\.

   >**Note**: Make sure to extract to this exact path. If you extract to a longer directory path, you will hit a Windows max 260 character path limit when you try to build the Visual Studio solution. You will not be able to download the NuGet packages. Keep the solution directory path short.

    ![In the Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders window, files will be extracted to C:\ConciergePlus.](media/image18.png "Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders window")

5. Open **ConciergePlusSentiment.sln** in the `C:\ConciergePlus\MCW-Intelligent-analytics-main\Hands-on lab\lab-files\starter-project` folder with Visual Studio 2019.

6. Sign in to Visual Studio or select create account, if prompted.

7. If presented with the Start with a familiar environment dialog, select Visual C\# from the Development Settings drop down list, and select Start Visual Studio.

    ![Development Settings is set to Visual C# in the Visual Studio Start with a familiar environment dialog box.](media/image19.png "Visual Studio Start with a familiar environment dialog box")

8. If the Security Warning window appears, uncheck Ask me for every project in this solution, and select OK.

    ![In the Security Warning window, under the Would you like to open this project? prompt, the Ask me for every project in this solution checkbox is highlighted and unchecked.](media/image20.png 'Security Warning window')

    ![The Visual Studio Solution explorer displays with the initial solution folder and files.](media/2020-08-16-17-20-03.png "Initial solution folder and files")

> **Note**: If you attempt to build the solution at this point, you will see many build errors. This is intentional. You will correct these in the exercises that follow.

> **Note**: Visual Studio Installer will show the installed version of Visual Studio and if the Azure SDK is installed. If the Azure SDK is missing, go back to the **Before the HOL** and make sure you created the correct VM. Updating Visual Studio manually may install components that may not work with the lab.

    ![A Visual Studio source code window is displayed with the method signature of the Run method shown.](media/2020-06-30-14-37-10.png "Run method")

4. Locate **TODO: 1** through **TODO: 5** comments and uncomment the code:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 1.Extract the JSON payload from the binary message
    string sourceEventHubEventBody = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.Body);
    var sentimentMessage = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MessageType>(sourceEventHubEventBody);

    //TODO: 6 Append sentiment score to chat message object
    //if (sentimentMessage.messageType.Equals("chat", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    //{
    //    sentimentMessage.score = await GetSentimentScore(sentimentMessage);
    //    log.LogInformation("SentimentScore: " + sentimentMessage.score);
    //}

    //TODO: 2.Create a Message (for Service Bus) and EventData instance (for EventHubs) from source message body
    var updatedMessage = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(sentimentMessage);
    var chatMessage  = new Message(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(updatedMessage));

    // Write the body of the message to the console.
    log.LogInformation($"Sending message: {updatedMessage}");

    //TODO: 3.Copy the message properties from source to the outgoing message instances
    foreach (var prop in eventData.Properties)
    {
        chatMessage.UserProperties.Add(prop.Key, prop.Value);
    }

    //TODO: 4.Send chat message to Topic
    // Send the message to the topic which will be eventually picked up by ChatHub.cs in the web app.
    await topicClient.SendAsync(chatMessage);

    //TODO: 5.Send chat message to next EventHub (for archival)
    using var eventBatch = archiveEventHubClient.CreateBatch();
    EventData updatedEventData = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(updatedMessage));

    eventBatch.TryAdd(updatedEventData);
    await archiveEventHubClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
    Console.WriteLine("Forwarded message to event hub.");
    ```

5. Save the file.

    > **Note**: It may take a couple of minutes for the browser to render. You must use a modern browser like Edge. If the site is opened in Internet Explorer, copy the URL from the address bar, open Edge (that you installed earlier), and navigate to the site with Edge instead.

### Task 4: Testing hotel lobby chat

1. Open a browser instance (Edge is recommended for this web app), and navigate to the deployment URL for your Web App.

    - If you are unsure what this URL is, it can be found in two places:

      - First, you can find it on the **ChatWebApp** document in **Visual Studio**, that was opened when you published the Web App.

        ![In the Visual Studio ChatWebbApp tab, under Summary, the Site URL is displayed.](media/2019-06-20-17-53-33.png "Visual Studio ChatWebbApp tab")

      - Alternatively, this can be found in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) on the **Overview** blade for your **Web App**.

2. Under the **Join Chat** area, enter your username (anything will do).

3. Leave **Hotel Lobby** selected.

4. Select the **Join** button.

5. The Live Chat should appear. Wait for a 1 minute. The first message warms up the system. You should see a message stating you have connected to the chat service and you have joined the session.

   The **connected** message means you have connected to the web application via SignalR.  The **join** message means you have sent a message to the event hub and the function app Event Hub Trigger copied the message to the service bus topic. Also, the web application has received the message using the topic subscription and pushed it the browser client.

   > **Warning**: Failure to see these messages means your configuration could be incorrect and will cause problems in the next exercises. Debugging steps are listed below.

    ![The Live Chat window displays, showing that it is connected to the chat service.](media/2020-06-29-10-15-14.png "Live Chat window")

    - Optional: Open the browser console. You should see similar SignalR debug messages.  Check for:
      - A WebSocket message (wss://). If you do not see this message, configure web sockets in your web application.
      - "ReceivedMessage was called." This means the event listener was set up correctly for the Service Bus topic subscription `ChatMessageSub`.

    ![The screenshot shows SignalR debug messages.](media/2020-08-17-08-58-40.png "SignalR Debug Messages")

6. Open another browser tab and navigate to the web site.

7. Enter `HotelLobby` (no spaces), and select **Join**.

8. From either session, fill in the Chat text box and select **Send**. You can try using @ and \# too, just to seed some text for search.

    ![The Live Chat window shows a chat going on between two users.](media/2020-06-29-10-17-13.png "Live Chat window")

9. Optional: Debugging Chat Messages

    - Event Hub Message Debugging.
      - Navigate back to the Azure Portal and select your resource group.
      - Select the event hub.
      - Select your event hub link.  e.g. awchathub.
      - Select the **Process Data** in the left-hand menu item.
      - Select the **Explore** button.

        ![The screenshot shows how to process event hub data.](media/2020-08-16-15-29-27.png "Process Event Hub Data")

      - Select the **Test query** link.  You may have to grant permissions.
        ![The image shows the Test query link highlighted](media/2020-08-16-15-33-01.png "Test query")

        Your chat messages should appear here.  This means your web application and event hub configuration settings are correct. If messages do not show, go back and check your Application Settings. Notice your messages are spread across the different partitions.

        ![The image shows test messages in the event hub.](media/2020-08-16-15-37-22.png "Event hub test messages")

    - Check your function app.

        > **Note**: _Debugging Tips_: If you navigate to the Azure Function Monitor, you can get more clues to any problems. Below is example of the log output. It can take up to 5 minutes for log entries to display.

        - Select your **ProcessChatMessage** function from the list of functions.

        - Select **Monitor** from the left-hand menu.

        ![The image shows the Function App Monitor link highlighted.](media/2020-08-16-16-12-48.png "Function App Monitor Link")

    ![The Azure Function log is shown with the output of an error displayed.](media/2019-11-24-07-23-56.png "Azure Function Monitor Log Example")

    - Check your Service Bus Subscription activity.
      - Navigate back to your service bus overview.  You should see the message count greater than zero. The web application is going to pull these messages and display them in the browser.

    ![The image shows the service bus activity. Message counts are greater than zero.](media/2020-08-16-16-28-44.png "Service bus activity")

10. Test your Stream Analytics Query.

    - Navigate back to your MessageLogger Stream Analytics job.
    - Select the Query item on the left-hand side.
    - Review the Event Hub `Input preview` and the Stream Analytics `Test results`.

    ![The screen shows how to test your Stream Analytics queries. The arrows point to the Query menu item and Test query button.](media/2020-07-02-16-53-08.png "Test your query")

## Exercise 4: Add intelligence

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement code to activate multiple cognitive intelligence services that act on the chat messages.

### Task 1: Implement sentiment analysis

In this task, you will add code that enables the Event Processor to invoke the Text Analytics API using the REST API and retrieve a sentiment score (a value between 0.0, negative, and 1.0, positive sentiment) for the text of a chat message.

1. In the **Solution Explorer** in **Visual Studio**, open **ProcessChatMessage.cs** in the **ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction** project.

2. Scroll down to the method **Run**.

3. Uncomment the code for **TODO: 6**. It should look like:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 6 Append sentiment score to chat message object
    if (sentimentMessage.messageType.Equals("chat", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        sentimentMessage.score = await GetSentimentScore(sentimentMessage);
        log.LogInformation("SentimentScore: " + sentimentMessage.score);
    }
    ```

4. Build your **ChatMessageSentimentProcessFunction** project.
5. Publish your **ChatMessageSentimentProcessFunction** project to Azure.
6. Test your sentiment query by selecting the sentiment query and selecting the `Test selected query` button.  Check your results.  Look at the **score** column. You should have all of the negative chat messages. Sentiment analysis has not been applied just yet. The sentiment analysis will be tested after the Language Understanding configuration has been completed.

    ![The screen shows the ability to test your queries before saving them.](media/testing-sentiment.png "Test your queries")

### Task 2: Implement linguistic understanding

What is the hotel guest's intention?

In this task, you will create a LUIS app, publish it, and then enable the Event Processor to invoke LUIS using the `Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Language.LUIS.Runtime` NuGet package. You will be setting up the LUIS model hierarchy and executing these steps.

![The diagram depicts the exercise steps. Create model, train model, test model, publish.](media/2020-06-30-14-22-42.png "LUIS workflow")

1. Using a browser, navigate to <http://www.luis.ai>.  

    > **Note**: If in Exercise 1, Step 12 you created your Luis account in Azure in a European region (e.g. West Europe), user <http://eu.luis.ai> instead. If you selected an Australian region use <http://au.luis.ai>.

2. Select **Login / Sign Up**.

3. Sign in using your Microsoft account (or \@Microsoft.com account if that is appropriate to you). The new account startup process may take a few minutes. If you are prompted to migrate to the Preview version of the LUIS portal, select **Migrate Later**.

4. On the **Welcome to the Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)!** window, select the appropriate Azure subscription in your tenant.

5. If you are prompted to **Choose an Authoring resource**, select the **luis-api-namespace-Authoring** resource and select **Done**

6. Select **Accept** terms button.

7. You should be redirected to the **Conversation apps** list page. In the toolbar, select **+ New app**.

    ![The My Apps table is displayed with the + New app button highlighted in the toolbar.](media/luis-new-conversation-app.png "Create LUIS app")

8. Complete the **Create a new app** form by providing `awchat` as the name for your LUIS app, selecting the **English** culture, selecting the **luis-api-namespace** prediction resource, and then selecting **Done**.

    ![In the Create a new app dialog box, the Name field is set to awchat, and Culture is set to English.](media/2020-08-18-17-46-45.png "Create new app")

9. Scroll through the examples of how to create the intents and utterances. Close the dialog.

10. In a moment, your new `awchat` app will appear.

11. Choose **Build** from the toolbar. In the **Intents** pane, select **+ Create** link.

    ![The top toolbar is displayed. The Build menu item is selected.](media/2019-06-20-19-55-55.png "Build Menu Item")

12. In the **Intents** dialog, for the **Intent Name** enter `OrderIn` and select **Done**.

    ![The OrderIn intent has been entered into the Create new intent dialog and the Done button is selected.](media/image118.png "Create a new intent")

13. Select **Entities** from the menu on the left.

    ![The Entities menu item is selected in the left menu.](media/2020-06-28-10-09-17.png "Entities menu")

14. Select **+Create**.

    ![On the Entities screen, the Create new entity button is selected on the toolbar.](media/2020-08-18-17-59-38.png "Create new entity")

15. For the **Entity name**, enter **RoomService**.  Select the **Create** button.

    ![The Add Entity dialog is displayed. Name and Entity Type are set to the preceding values.](media/2020-06-28-08-18-43.png "Add Entity dialog box")

16. Return to the **OrderIn** intent screen to enter `utterances`.

    ![The OrderIn intent item is selected.](media/2020-06-28-08-31-26.png "Return to OrderIn Intent")

17. In the example input text box, enter the "order a pizza" utterance and **press the Enter key to save your work**.

18. Your newly created pizza utterance is shown below. Select the utterance with your mouse and associate it with the RoomService entity in the dropdown. Upon entity selection, your work will be saved.

    ![The screen shows the order a pizza utterance highlighted and a dropdown menu displaying RoomService entity.](media/2020-06-28-08-36-52.png "Associate the entity")

    Your work is saved automatically.

    ![The order pizza utterance is displayed with associated RoomService entity.](media/2020-06-28-08-40-56.png "Example of saved utterance")
19. Time to train your model.  Select the Train button in the upper right.  You should see the following result:

    ![The picture shows the Train button with a green circle and a message of 'Predictions loaded' displayed.](media/2020-06-28-08-45-49.png "Prediction loaded confirmation")

20. Now, it is time to test your model.  Select the Test button. Type in, "I would like to order a pizza" into the text box and select the `Enter` key. Select the **Inspect** link. You should see a correlation result above to 90% as well as the associated ML entity.

    ![The screen shows the original test phrase and the test results.](media/2020-06-28-08-55-50.png "Inspecting the test results")

    It is important to see a high correlation (above .75) and a resulting ML entity because the chat application needs it in order to send the message to the correct hotel department. Below is the code from the function application that determines if there is an utterance match.

    ![The screen shows the chat processing code and the reason for making sure the entity and intent is returned.](media/2020-06-29-05-10-51.png "Code sample of intent handler")

21. Repeat this process for the following phrases and associate them with the **RoomService** entity:

    - I am hungry
    - order food
    - order a hamburger
    - order a soda
    - order dinner
    - order breakfast
    - order a drink

22. Create a **Housekeeping** entity. It is also a **Machine learned** entity.

23. Create the following utterances and associate them with the Housekeeping entity. To do this, select **Intents** and **OrderIn**.

    - more towels
    - more blankets
    - room too warm
    - room too cold
    - I am cold
    - I am too hot

24. Train and test your model.  Did you get the expected test results?

25. Enter one more utterance, `order a hotdog`. There is some new functionality in LUIS. Notice the predicted label/entity may be suggested for you.  Confirm the **RoomService** entity. Train and test your model.

    ![The screenshot shows the new machine learning prediction for the utterance. The user did not have to select the phrase and associated it with the entity.](media/2020-08-18-19-02-58.png "Machine learning entity prediction")

    ![The screenshot shows the Confirm RoomService option highlighted](media/2020-08-18-19-04-47.png "Confirm RoomService")

26. Select **Manage** from the toolbar, then select **Azure Resources** from the left menu. In the **luis-api-namespace** section, the URL is available in the **Example Query** textbox. 

    ![The Azure Resources menu item is selected from the left menu and the Example Query URL is shown in a textbox.](media/2020-08-18-19-27-46.png "LUIS Key Information")

27. Select **Publish** at the upper right-hand corner of the page to publish the endpoint. Publish to the **Staging Slot** and select **Done**.

    ![Publishing the awchat app LUIS endpoint to the staging slot.](./media/publish-luis-to-staging-slot.PNG "Staging slot deployment")

28. Open a new tab in your browser. Paste the **Example Query** URL into the address bar and modify the end of the URL (the text following q= ) so it contains the phrase `bring me towels` and press **ENTER**. You should receive output similar to the following. Observe that it correctly identified the intent as **OrderIn** (in this case with a confidence of nearly 100%) and the entity as having an entity type of **Housekeeping** (in this case with a confidence score of 97.5%).

    ```json
    {
        "query": "bring me towels",
        "prediction": {
            "topIntent": "OrderIn",
            "intents": {
                "OrderIn": {
                    "score": 0.98740774
                },
                "None": {
                    "score": 0.008991768
                }
            },
            "entities": {
                "Housekeeping": [
                    "bring me towels"
                ],
                "$instance": {
                    "Housekeeping": [
                        {
                            "type": "Housekeeping",
                            "text": "bring me towels",
                            "startIndex": 0,
                            "length": 15,
                            "score": 0.97544956,
                            "modelTypeId": 1,
                            "modelType": "Entity Extractor",
                            "recognitionSources": [
                                "model"
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

29. Note that LUIS can learn from challenges it faces when it's deployed. For example, if your LUIS endpoint failed to determine entities for the "bring me towels" query, navigate to **Review endpoint utterances** below **Improve app performance**. Once you ensure that the **Predicted Intent** is **OrderIn**, associate the utterance with the proper entity (such as **Housekeeping**). Select **Save**. Then, select **Train** and **Publish**.

    ![Associating a low-performing utterance with the correct entity.](./media/review-endpoint-utterances-luis.png "Improving LUIS model performance after deployment")

30. Go back to the **luis-api-namespace** screen. Capture three LUIS values and add them to the Azure Function application settings.

    ```text
    LuisPredictionKey
    LuisBaseUrl
    LuisAppId
    ```

    !["The screenshot shows the LUIS Starter_Key settings. Three application settings are highlighted. LuisPredictionKey, LuisBaseUrl, and LuisAppId"](media/2020-08-18-19-32-28.png "LUIS Application Settings")

31. In the LUIS web page, select the **Publish** button.

    ![The screenshot shows the Publish button highlighted.](media/2020-08-18-20-08-05.png "Publish Slot Button")

32. Select the **Production Slot** setting.  Select the **Done** button.

    ![The screenshot shows the publishing slot settings. The Production Slot is selected.](media/2020-08-18-20-05-23.png "Production Slot")

33. **Save** your Application Settings. The Event Processor is pre-configured to invoke the LUIS API using the provided App ID and key.

34. Open **Visual Studio** then open **ProcessChatMessage.cs** within the **ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction** project, and navigate to the Run method.

35. Locate **TODO: 7** and uncomment the code:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 7.Respond to chat message intent if appropriate
    var updatedMessageObject = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MessageType>(updatedMessage);

    // Get your most likely intent based on your message.
    var intent = await GetIntentAndEntities(updatedMessageObject.message);
    await HandleIntent(intent, updatedMessageObject, topicClient);
    ```

36. Take a look at the implementation of both methods if you are curious how the entity and intent information is used to generate an automatic chat message response from a bot.

37. Save the file.

### Task 3: Re-deploy the function application and test

Now that you have added sentiment analysis and language understanding to the solution, you need to re-deploy the apps so you can test out the new functionality.

1. Build and Publish the **ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction** Function App using **Visual Studio**.

2. Open the Hotel Lobby web page. Join a chat in the **Hotel Lobby**.

3. Type a message with a positive sentiment, like `I love this weather`. Observe the **thumbs-up** icon that appears next to the chat message you sent. Next, type something like, `I hate this weather` and observe the **thumbs-down** icon. These are indicators of sentiment (as applied by your solution in real-time).

    ![In the Live Chat window, callouts point to the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons. The 'love this weather' statement produces a thumbs-up icon. Thumbs down for the 'I have this weather'](media/2020-06-29-05-44-34.png "Live Chat window")

4. Next, try ordering some items from room service, like `bring me towels` and `order a pizza`. Observe that you get a response from the **ConciergeBot**, and that the reply indicates whether your request was sent to **Housekeeping** or **Room Service**, depending on whether the item ordered was a room or food item.

    ![In the chat window, Tim is having a conversation with a ConciergeBot. He asks for towels, and the ConciergeBot says they are forwarding the request to Housekeeping.](media/2020-06-29-05-47-15.png "Live Chat window")

### (Optional) Task 4: Improve LUIS Model Performance

As mentioned previously, LUIS captures challenging queries from production use and allows developers to improve, train, test, and deploy their Language Understanding models. The key component that supports this feature is the `log=true` query parameter that is part of the LUIS endpoint.

1. In [LUIS](luis.ai), select the **awchat** conversation app.

2. Select **Review endpoint utterances** below **Improve app performance**.

    ![LUIS endpoint utterances.](./media/review-endpoint-utterances-after-deploy.png "Utterances from the LUIS production endpoint")

3. Consider the first utterance shown above (`the food was terrible`). As this is not a request, and should thus not be routed to neither the Housekeeping nor RoomService entities, the developer must change the **Predicted Intent** to **None**. Then, they must select **Save utterance**.

4. Same applies to the `hello!` utterance. It is not a request, so the developer will change the predicted intent to **None**.

    >**Note**: Is it possible to define an intent for greetings, given that customers will likely issue a greeting before conversing through the app? Will that add value to the app? What entities could you associate with a greetings intent? Defining a logical schema is a critical part of using LUIS.

5. Move test entries that have incorrectly been classified as requests to the **None** intent. Notice how those utterances are now accessible under the **None** intent.

    ![None intent in LUIS with utterances.](./media/none-intent.png "Utterances properly classified as the None intent")

6. Once you've dealt with the suggested utterances, **Train** and **Test** the LUIS model.

## Exercise 5: Building the Power BI dashboard

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have the solution deployed and exchanging messages, you can build a Power BI dashboard that monitors the sentiments of the messages being exchanged in real time. The following steps walk through the creation of the dashboard.

### Task 1: Provision Power BI

If you do not already have a Power BI account:

1. Go to <https://powerbi.microsoft.com/features/>.

2. Scroll down until you see the **Try Power BI for free!** section of the page, and select the **Try Free** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Power BI Try for free section.](media/setup3.png "Power BI Try for free section")

3. On the page, enter your work email address (which should be the same account as the one you use for your Azure subscription), and select **Sign up**.

    ![The Get started page has a field for entering your work email address.](media/setup4.png "Get started page")

4. Follow the on-screen prompts, and your Power BI environment should be ready within minutes. You can always return to it via <https://app.powerbi.com/>.

### Task 2: Create the static dashboard

1. Sign in to your Power BI subscription (<https://app.powerbi.com>).

2. Select **My Workspace** on the left-hand menu, then select the **Datasets** tab. Depending on your Power BI version, it may read **Datasets + dataflows**.

    ![In the Power BI window, on the left menu, My Workspace is selected. In the right pane, the Datasets tab is selected.](media/image140.png "Power BI window")

3. Under the **Datasets** (or **Datasets + dataflows**) list, select the **Messages** dataset.

    ![On the Datasets tab, the Messages dataset is highlighted in the table.](media/image141.png "Datasets tab")

4. Select the **Create report** button after clicking the three dots.

    ![On the Datasets + dataflows tab, the Create Report button is selected.](media/create-report-from-messages.png "Datasets + dataflows tab")

5. On the **Visualizations** palette, select **Gauge** to create a semi-circular gauge.

    ![On the Visualizations palette, the Gauge icon is highlighted.](media/image143.png "Visualizations palette")

6. In the **Fields** listing, select and drag the **score** field and drop it onto the **Value** field.

    ![In the Visualizations blade, the Gauge is selected. From the Fields blade under Messages, the score check box is selected. An arrow points from this to the Value field in the Visualizations pane indicating a drag and drop operation. Score is now listed as the Value in Visualizations.](media/image144.png "Visualizations and Fields listings")

7. Select the drop-down menu that appears where you dropped score and select **Average**.

    ![Average is selected from the Value drop down box in the Visualizations blade.](media/image145.png "Drop-down menu")

8. You now should have a gauge that shows the average sentiment for all the data collected so far, which should look similar to the following. If you have not sent many messages, the average sentiment may be a negative value, as the chat processor set a sentiment of -1 before you implemented proper Text Analytics sentiment analysis.

    ![A semi-circle gauge graph displays for Average of score, which is 0.62.](media/image146.png "Gauge graph")

9. From the **File** menu, select **Save** to save your visualization to a new report.

    ![On the toolbar the File menu is expanded and Save (Save this report) is selected.](media/image147.png "File menu")

10. Enter `ChatSentiment` for the report name, and select **Save**.

    ![In the Save your report window, ChatSentiment is typed in as the name of the report.](media/image148.png "Save your report window")

### Task 3: Create the real-time dashboard

This gauge is currently a static visualization. You will use the report just created to seed a dashboard whose visualizations update as new messages arrive.

1. Select the **Pin to a dashboard** item located on the toolbar. You will need to select the three dots to find this item.

    ![On the toolbar, the Pin to a dashboard button is selected.](media/pin-gauge-to-dashboard.png "Gauge control menu bar")

2. Select **New dashboard**, enter `Real-time Sentiment` as the name, and select **Pin Live**.

    ![On the Pin to dashboard dialog box, on the left, a Preview of the ChatSentiment Gauge graph displays. On the right, under Where would you like to pin to, the New dashboard radio button is selected.](media/2019-06-21-09-41-59.png "Pin to dashboard dialog box")

3. Return to the **My Workspace** page, and select your newly created dashboard from the list of dashboards.

    ![My Workspace dashboards list is displayed with the Real-time Sentiment dashboard selected.](media/image151.png 'My Workspace dashboards')

4. Real-time dashboards are created in Power BI using the Q&A feature, by typing in a question to visualize in the space provided. In the **Ask a question about your data** field, enter: `average score created between yesterday and today`.

    ![The input text box placeholder texts states Ask a question about your data.](media/2019-03-21-10-26-35.png "Ask a question about your data")

    ![average score created between yesterday and today is typed in the Ask question about your data textbox. An average of score (0.62) displays below.](media/image152.png "Ask question about your data field")

5. Next, convert this to a Gauge chart by expanding the **Visualizations** palette at right, and selecting on the **Gauge** control. You will need to set the **New Q&A experience** to **Off** in order to see the **Visualizations** palette. This switch is on the toolbar on the right-hand side.

    ![The Visualizations palette expand button is selected.](media/image153.png "Visualizations palette")

6. In the **Visualizations** palette, select the **Gauge** control. Select the **Format** (paint roller) icon and expand the **Gauge axis** section. Format the Gauge axis so it ranges between **0.0** and **1.0** and has a **target** (indicator) set at **0.5**.

    ![On the Visualizations palette, the Gauge graph icon is selected. Beneath that, the brush icon is selected. Under Gauge axis, the following values are defined: Min, 0. Max, 1.0. Target, 0.5.](media/image154.png "Visualizations list")

10. In the list of dashboards, select your **Real-time Sentiment** dashboard. Your new gauge should appear next to your original gauge. If the original gauge fills the whole screen, you may need to scroll down to see the new gauge. You can delete the original gauge if you prefer. (Select the top of the visualization, then ellipses that appear, and then, the trash can icon.)

    ![Two Average of score Gauge graphs display, and both share the same data.](media/image158.png "Gauge graphs")

11. Navigate to the chat website you deployed and send some messages and observe how the sentiment gauge updates with moments of you sending chat messages.

### Task 4: Add a trending sentiment chart to the dashboard

The sentiment visualization you created is great for getting a sense of sentiment as of this moment. However, First Up Consultants wishes to view sentiment over time for historical reference and to see whether overall sentiment is trending one way or another. To do this, we will use the tumbling window query output from Stream Analytics to display this data in a line chart.

1. While still in **Power BI**, select **My Workspace** once again, then select the **Datasets** (or **Datasets + dataflows**) tab. You should see the **TrendingSentiment** dataset dynamically created by Stream Analytics. Select the **Create Report** action.

    ![Go to My Workspace, then the Datasets tab, the TrendingSentiment dataset is listed, the Create Report button is selected next to this dataset.](media/create-report-trending-sentiment-dataset.png "Power BI Datasets")

2. Select the **Line chart** visualization.

    ![In the Visualizations palette, the Line chart visualization is selected.](media/power-bi-line-chart-visualization.png "Power BI Line Chart")

3. Drag the **average** field to the **Values** setting, and **snapshot** to **Axis**.

    ![Arrows indicating drag and drop operations show average in the Values field and snapshot in the Axis field.](media/power-bi-line-chart-settings.png "Power BI Line Chart")

4. Resize the line chart and observe how the average sentiment is tracked over time.

    ![Screenshot of the line chart displaying trending sentiment over time.](media/power-bi-trending-sentiment-chart.png "Power BI Line Chart")

5. Select **Save this report** on the top of the page. Name the report `Trending Sentiment` when prompted.

    ![The Save icon is selected from the toolbar.](media/power-bi-save-report.png "Save this report")

6. Next, select **Pin to a dashboard**.

    ![The Pin to a dashboard button is selected from the toolbar.](media/pin-to-dashboard.png "Pin to a dashboard")

7. In the **Pin to dashboard** dialog, select **Existing dashboard**, select the dashboard you created previously, then select **Pin live**.

    ![The Pin to dashboard dialog shows the report will be pinned to an existing dashboard and has the Real-time Sentiment dashboard selected in a drop down list.](media/power-bi-pin-to-dashboard.png "Pin to dashboard")

8. Position the Trending Sentiment line chart beneath the average score gauge.

    ![Power BI dashboard showing the average score gauges and trending sentiment.](media/power-bi-dashboard-with-trending-sentiment.png "Power BI Dashboard")

9. Try building out the rest of the real-time dashboard that should look as follows. We provide the following Q&A questions you can use to get started.

    ![The Power BI dashboard has four panes: two Count of Messages panes, an Average Sentiment, and Upset Users. The first Count of Messages pane displays a number (18). The second Count of Messages is a pie chart broken out by username. The Average Sentiment is a donut chart displaying the Average Sentiment (0.58) in the past 24 hours. Upset Users chart is a horizontal bar chart displaying the average of upset users (0.25) in the past 24 hours.](media/image159.png "Power BI Dashboard")

    - Count of Messages (Card visualization): Count of messages between yesterday and today.

    - Count of Messages by Username (Pie chart visualization): Count of messages by username between yesterday and today.

    - Upset Users (Bar chart visualization): Average score by username between yesterday and today.

10. Invite some peers to chat and monitor the sentiments using your new, real-time dashboard.

## Exercise 6: Enabling search indexing

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have primed the system with some messages, you will create a Search Index and an Indexer in Azure Search upon the messages that are collected in Azure Cosmos DB.
