4. Follow the on-screen prompts, and your Power BI environment should be ready within minutes. You can always return to it via <https://app.powerbi.com/>.

### Task 2: Setup a lab virtual machine (VM)

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select +Create a resource, then type "Visual Studio" into the search bar. Select Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64) from the results. ![In the Azure Portal Everything section, under Results, under Name, Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 is circled.](media/setup5.png 'Azure Portal Everything section')

2. On the blade that comes up, at the bottom, ensure the deployment model is set to Resource Manager, and select Create.

    ![At the Bottom of the blade, Resource Manager is selected as the deployment model.](media/setup6.png 'Bottom of the blade')

3. Set the following configuration on the Basics tab.

    * Name: Enter **LabVM**

    * VM disk type: Select **SSD**

    * User name: Enter **demouser**

    * Password: Enter **Password.1!!**

    * Subscription: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

    * Resource Group: Select Create new, and enter **intelligent-analytics** as the name of the new resource group.

    * Location: Select a region close to you.

4. Select **OK** to move to the next step.

5. On the Choose a size blade, ensure the Supported disk type is set to SSD, and select View all. This machine won't be doing much heavy lifting, so selecting DS2_V3 Standard is a good baseline option.

    ![The Choose a size blade has the D2S_V3 Standard option circled. The circled fields are Supported disk type, which is set to SSD, and the View all button.](media/setup8.png 'Choose a size blade')

6. Click **Select** to move on to the Settings blade.

7. Accept all the default values on the Settings blade, and select **OK**.

8. Select Create on the Create blade to provision the virtual machine.

    ![The Create blade shows that validation passed, and provides the offer details.](media/setup9.png 'Create blade')
