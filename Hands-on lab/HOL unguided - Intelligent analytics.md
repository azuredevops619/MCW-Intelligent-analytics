# Intelligent analytics hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to many of Microsoft's transformative line of business applications built using Microsoft advanced analytics. The goal is to show an end-to-end solution, leveraging many of these technologies, but not necessarily doing work in every component possible.

By the end of the hands-on lab, you will be more confident in the various services and technologies provided by Azure, and how they can be combined to build a real-time chat solution that is enhanced by Cognitive Services.

## Overview

First Up Consultants specializes in building software solutions for the hospitality industry. Their latest product is an enterprise mobile/social chat product called Concierge+ (aka ConciergePlus). The mobile web app enables guests to easily stay in touch with the concierge and other guests, enabling greater personalization and improving their experience during their stay. Sentiment analysis is performed on top of chat messages as they occur, enabling hotel operators to keep tabs on guest sentiments in real-time.

## Solution architecture

Below are diagrams of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The preferred solution is shown to meet the customer requirements. From right to left there is an architecture diagram which shows the connections from a mobile device to a Web Application. The Web Application is shown setting data to an Event Hub which is connected to a Web Job. From there Event Hub and Service Bus work together with Stream Analytics, Power BI and Cosomos DB to provide the full solution.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Intelligentanalyticsimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture")
