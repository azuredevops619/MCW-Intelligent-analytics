# Intelligent analytics

First Up Consultants specializes in building software solutions for the hospitality industry. Their latest product is an enterprise mobile/social chat product called Concierge+ (aka ConciergePlus). The mobile web app enables guests to easily stay in touch with the concierge and other guests, enabling greater personalization and improving their experience during their stay. Sentiment analysis is performed on top of chat messages as they occur, enabling hotel operators to keep tabs on guest sentiments in real-time.

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop you will learn real-time analytics without IoT.  You'll enable intelligent conversation in a machine learning enabled, real-time chat pipeline, and apply analytics to visualize customer sentiment in real time for hotel guests, allowing them to chat with one another, and to communicate directly with the concierge. You'll apply analytics to visualize customer sentiment in real-time, as well as view trending sentiment over time and create a bot that can answer questions and embed it in the custom web app.
 You will be able to implement a lambda architecture, and enable web-based, real-time messaging through Web Sockets, Event Hubs, and Services Bus. 

At the end of this workshop, you will better understand how to leverage Cognitive Services (LUIS & Text Analytics API), process events with Azure functions, index with Search Archive and Cosmos DB, visualize with Power BI Q&A, use Bot Framework for questions and answers, and send notifications with Logic App.

### Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design a solution for building a real-time chat pipeline, incorporating machine learning and analytics to detect and visualize customer sentiment. You will also design a lambda architecture to handle both real-time chat processing and data archiving as well as search indexing for analyzing all data flowing through the system. Finally, you will determine whether a bot can be incorporated in the solution, and how it fits alongside the messaging capabilities.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will have a better understanding about how to design a real-time intelligent chat solution in Azure, which is scalable, enhanced by pre-built machine learning models, and the role bots can play as part of your overall solution.

### Hands-on Lab

This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to many of Microsoft's transformative line of business applications built using Microsoft advanced analytics. The goal is to show an end-to-end solution, leveraging many of these technologies, but not necessarily doing work in every component possible.

By the end of the hands-on lab, you will be more confident in the various services and technologies provided by Azure, and how they can be combined to build a real-time chat solution that is enhanced by Cognitive Services.
